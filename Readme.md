<!-- Brief Introduction to JavaScript  -->

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamically typed,
 single-threaded programming language used to build interactive web applications. It runs in the browser to manipulate the DOM and handle user events, and it can also run on the server using Node.js.
1
✅ What it means
You don’t manage memory manually like C/C++.
🧠 Why important
JavaScript is easy to write and human-readable.
👉 Example:
 why high level -> you dont have think about memory management You don’t allocate memory manually.
let x = 10;


 2. Dynamically Typed
✅ What it means
You don’t need to define data types.
👉 Example:let x = 10;     // number
x = "hello";    // now string
 dynmically typed-> dont need to declare datatype before declaring varible.


3. Single-Threaded
✅ What it means.
Execute one task at a time 
used to build interactive webpages 
make a static webiste dynamic 
by making the content alive 

4.
handles user events 
click, scroll typing mouse move.


JavaScript is a single-threaded, dynamically typed language used to build interactive web apps in browsers and servers.

<!-- Values and variables  -->
value - is smallest unit of information 
console.log("jonas")
10        // number
"Hello"   // string
true      // boolean
null
undefine


what is variable ?
A variable is a container used to store values so we can reuse and manipulate them in a program.

js keyword  name of variable and then value.

let firstName = Abhishek
consol.log(firstName)



<!-- Data types  -->

1 number : floating point numbers used for decimal and integers let age = 23;
2 string : sequence of characters used for text let firstName = 'Jonas'
3 Boolean : logical type that can only be true or false let fullage = True;

4 Undefined: Means a variable has been declared but hasn't been given a value yet. The language assigns this automatically.
Example: let name; (the value of name is undefined)

5 Null: Represents an intentional absence of any value. It's a value you, the programmer, assign to a variable to explicitly say "this is empty".
Example: let data = null;

6 Symbol: A unique and immutable value, introduced in ES6, often used as an identifier for object properties to avoid naming conflicts.
Example: Symbol("id")

7 BigInt: Used for representing whole numbers that are larger than the Number type can safely handle. You create a BigInt by adding n to the end of a number.
Example: 12345678901234567890n


<!-- let , var and const -->
let var and const are the keywords of javaScript used to declare variables 

var is function/global scope  we can reassign it and also redeclare it.

let is block scope we can reassign the value but cannot redecalre it.

const is block scope  cannot reassign and Redeclare. 


<!--Operators-->
Transform values or Combine values 
Mathematical and Logical Operations

<!-- opertor precedence -->
order of operations which operator will operate first  
Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).





<!-- strings and template literals  -->

string is a Sequence of character which we used to create Sentence 

<!-- template literals  -->
introduced in Es6, are a modern way to work with strings in javascirpt to make our life simple



<!-- conditionals  -->
To perform any actions based on the decision we use if and else statements.
To run some programming parts of our program we use conditions. 

if(decision){ // if this line is true execute code int the if block 
    block of code 
}else { 
    do this 
}



const age = 19; 
const isOldEnough = age>=18;

if(isolodengouh){
    consolelog(sarah can drive )
}

if(age>=18){
    consolelog(sarah can drive )
   
} else {
     some calculation to check how years are left 
}

<!-- we use else block whenever the if block false  -->
it is called control structure 
so that we have some block of code which will run and other block code will not based on the conditions.
if(){

}else{

}

<!-- lets make a program for centurey  -->
let centur;
const birthYear = 1991;
if(birthYear <=2000){
 centur = 20;
}else{
    century = 21;
}






<!-- Type conversion and Coercion --> 

Type conversion its a process in js where one data is converted manually into another type

coercion means the data type will convert automatically 


<!-- Truthy and falsy value -->

These are some truthy values
Non-zero numbers: 42, -1, 3.14
Non-empty strings: "hello", "0", " "
Objects and arrays: {}, []
Functions: function() {}
Dates: new Date()
Symbols: Symbol()
BigInt values other than 0n: 10n

What Are Falsy Values?
Falsy values are values that evaluate to false when used in a Boolean. JavaScript has a fixed list of falsy values

false
0 (and -0)
0n (BigInt zero)
"" (empty string)
null
undefined
NaN
document.all (used for backward compatibility)


== checks the eaqulity value not type 
=== checks for strict equality (both type and value).




Statements vs Expressions

This is VERY important for backend interviews.

🔹 Statement

A complete instruction.

let x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
  console.log("Big");
}


These are statements.

🔹 Expression

Something that produces a value.

10 + 5          // 15
x > 5           // true
"Hello" + "JS"  // "HelloJS"




/////////
Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator)

It’s a short version of if...else.

✅ Syntax
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;

Example
let age = 18;

let message = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(message);


👉 Output: Adult

Convert this to ternary:
let score = 80;
let result;

if (score >= 50) {
  result = "Pass";
} else {
  result = "Fail";
}



<!-- Strict Mode  -->
we use to avoid accidental bugs and erros.



<!-- Functions -->
Fucntions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They allow you to organize, reuse and modularize code .It can take inpust,perform actions, and return outputs.


So When to Use What?

Use function declarations for main logic

Use function expressions when assigning to variables or passing into other functions


Array 
Array is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable.
Each value inside an array has a position called an index.
index always starts with 0.

Objects
An object is a data structure used to store data in key–value pairs.
Instead of index (like arrays), objects use keys.




<!-- What is dom ?  -->
Dom stands for Documenet Object model: Structured Representation of HTML
Documents.Allows javascript to access html elements and styles to manipulate them.
for each element in html there is one element node in the dom tree we 


dom is a complete representation of document


When a web page loads, the browser creates something called the DOM (Document Object Model).

In the DOM:

Every HTML element becomes an object

That object is called a Node

💻 Example

HTML:

<p id="text">Hello</p>


JavaScript:

let element = document.getElementById("text");

console.log(element);


Here:

<p> is an HTML element

element is a JavaScript object

It has properties like:

element.innerText

element.id

element.style

element.classList

So yes — it has “extra information” (properties and methods).
